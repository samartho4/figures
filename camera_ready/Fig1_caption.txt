Schematic of the two-equation microgrid model showing UDE and BNODE injection points. The model tracks storage energy (x₁) and net power/frequency surrogate (x₂) with physics terms including charge/discharge efficiencies, damping, and coupling coefficient γ. UDE replaces the β·P_gen(t) term with a learned residual f_θ(P_gen), while BNODE learns the entire vector field in parallel. Data source: checkpoints/ude_best_tuned.bson; commit: 8b5220a.
